# Crypto-Exploit-Info-Bot

The inDemniFi Twitter Bot is designed to search Twitter for tweets referencing crypto exploits and retrieve all exploit information to aggregate and analyze. The collected data will be visualized in a Power BI report on our website, available at [inDemniFi.Crypto](https://inDemniFi.Crypto). Users can also submit crypto exploit information through a form on our [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/inDemniFi).

## Website

You can access the inDemniFi website at [inDemniFi.Crypto](https://inDemniFi.Crypto). Please note that the website is stored on IPFS, so ensure you have a compatible browser like [Brave](https://brave.com) or [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) with the [Unstoppable Domains extension](https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension) installed.

On the inDemniFi website, you will find the State of Cryptocurrency Underwriting Report, an interactive Power BI report. This report showcases the insights gained from the aggregation and analysis of exploit information collected from the Twitter bot and contributors. It provides a comprehensive overview of the risks associated with different protocols, identifies patterns and trends in the cryptocurrency landscape, and evaluates the effectiveness of security measures.

Through the interactive features of the Power BI report, users can explore the data, visualize key metrics, and gain a deeper understanding of the state of cryptocurrency underwriting. The report offers a range of filters, charts, and graphs to help users dive into specific aspects of interest, such as the frequency and severity of exploits, the impact on different chains, and the relationship between various risk factors.

We encourage users to leverage the interactive capabilities of the Power BI report to customize their analysis, generate insights, and inform their decision-making processes. The report aims to empower industry participants, including cryptocurrency developers, investors, insurers, and regulators, by enhancing their understanding of the risks involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and fostering proactive risk management practices.

Please note that the data and analysis provided in the State of Cryptocurrency Underwriting Report are based on the available information and should be used as a reference for informed decision-making. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, it is important to continuously monitor and adapt risk management strategies.

## Process and Autonomy 

The process involves:

1. **Data Collection**: The inDemniFi Twitter Bot retrieves exploit information from Twitter and collects user submissions through the provided form. The data is stored and organized for further analysis.

2. **Data Aggregation**: The collected data is aggregated to identify common characteristics, such as the affected blockchain, type of exploit, severity, and impacted assets.

3. **Data Analysis**: Utilizing actuarial science and data analysis techniques, we analyze the collected data to identify trends, patterns, and potential risk factors. This analysis helps us assess the overall state of cryptocurrency underwriting and identify areas of improvement.

4. **Risk Assessment**: By combining the analysis results with risk management principles, we evaluate the level of risk associated with different cryptocurrencies and chains. This assessment informs decision-making processes for risk mitigation strategies and insurance underwriting.

### State of Cryptocurrency Underwriting

The inDemniFi project combines actuarial science, data analysis, and risk management principles to assess the state of cryptocurrency underwriting. Through the aggregation and analysis of exploit information collected from the Twitter bot and contributors through our GitHub and Twitter form, we aim to provide insights into the risks associated with different protocols.

By leveraging actuarial techniques and data analysis methodologies, we can identify patterns, trends, and potential vulnerabilities within the cryptocurrency landscape. This analysis helps us understand the frequency and severity of exploits, assess the impact on different chains, and evaluate the effectiveness of security measures. We also consider factors such as the auditing programming languages, auditors, protocols, and historical developers associated with known protocols and projects.

The State of Cryptocurrency Underwriting report serves as an output of this analysis. It provides valuable insights for industry participants, including cryptocurrency developers, investors, insurers, and regulators. The report aims to enhance the understanding of the risks involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and foster proactive risk management practices.

Please note that the analysis and insights provided are based on the available data and should be used as a reference for informed decision-making. It is important to continuously monitor and adapt risk management strategies as the cryptocurrency landscape evolves.

## Cross-checking Exploit Information

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the exploit information collected from Twitter, the bot performs cross-checking with the actual details in the blockchains. It leverages the following blockchain explorers and APIs:

- [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/): Provides detailed information and transaction data for the Ethereum blockchain, one of the most popular blockchains in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem according to platforms like DeFiLlama.
- [FtmScan](https://ftmscan.com/): Offers insights and data for the Fantom blockchain, another prominent blockchain in the DeFi space.
- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/): Provides access to data and analytics for the Polygon (Matic) blockchain, which has gained significant traction in the DeFi ecosystem.
- [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/): Offers tools and data for the Cosmos blockchain ecosystem, known for its interoperability features and multiple connected blockchains.
- [Binance](https://www.binance.org/): Provides blockchain explorer functionality for the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain that has seen rapid growth and adoption in both centralized and decentralized finance.
- [Solana](https://solana.com/): Offers insights and data for the Solana blockchain, known for its high throughput and low fees, making it attractive for DeFi applications.
- [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/): Provides access to data and analytics for the Arbitrum blockchain, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that aims to improve transaction throughput and efficiency.
- [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/): Offers tools and data for the Avalanche blockchain, a high-performance platform designed for decentralized applications and financial primitives.
- [Optimism](https://optimism.io/): Provides insights and data for the Optimism blockchain, another layer 2 solution for Ethereum focused on scalability and reducing transaction costs.

By utilizing these explorers and APIs, the bot verifies the information obtained from Twitter by comparing it with the relevant blockchain data. This process helps ensure the accuracy and integrity of the collected exploit information.
